# CS224N
In this repository you can find my coding and written solutions for assignments 1-5 of the Stanford CS224N class(of Winter 22/23), featuring:
* Assignment 1: Introduction to word vectors
* Assignment 2: Derivatives and implementation of word2vec algorithm
* Assignment 3: Dependency parcing and neural network foundations
* Assignment 4: Neural Machine Translation with sequence-to-sequence, attention, and subwords
* Assignment 5: Self-supervised learning and fine-tuning with Transformers
  
All coding segments passed their relevant sanity checks and were able to compile into models roughly of the expected specifications. For the math questions, I sometimes referred to the existing solutions provided by [Florian Kark](https://github.com/floriankark/cs224n-win2223) to verify my own answers - there are disagreements there sometimes, which you may want to research.

Note: Instead of completing A4 and A5 on Azure, I utilized Google Colab. In A5, you may need to convert all scripts from CRLF to LF (for example via VSC) and set the workers to 2 instead for your code to run.
